2. **Quality UI/UX**
   - Many existing apps have "20-year-old" interfaces
   - Mobile experiences often "almost unusable"
   - Opportunity: Modern, intuitive design

   - Player data siloed in individual apps
   - Opportunity: Universal player profiles, data export

10. **Recreation Department Integration**
